# Azure Cloud Security Lab

This repository documents the design and implementation of a secure Azure environment following Zero Trust and least-privilege principles.

## 🔐 Security Controls Implemented

- **Network Security Groups (NSG)** — controlled inbound traffic using least privilege
- **Azure Key Vault** — secure storage of secrets with RBAC access control
- **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** — security posture assessment and recommendations
- **Microsoft Sentinel** — centralized logging and threat detection (SIEM)
- **RBAC Troubleshooting** — resolved access issues using role-based access control

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Azure resources send logs to a Log Analytics Workspace, which is monitored by Microsoft Sentinel for threat detection and incident visibility.
